# AoC 2020 Solutions

I'll be honest: I don't put a lot of effort into these. I'm not sitting here
contemplating the best strategy or the fastest algorithm - I'm banging out
whatever works and leaving at that. These solutions may be dumb, unmaintainable,
poorly-thought-out, unidiomatic... but that's what happens when the incentive
behind the competition is to be the first to come up with a solution.

This year I'm using Python. Next year I want to use my own scripting language,
but I've been saying that for a while.

I write all of my solutions in [my editor](https://github.com/klange/bim).
